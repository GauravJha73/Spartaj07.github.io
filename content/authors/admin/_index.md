      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

As a Product Development Engineer Intern at Bosch, I am passionate about designing and creating innovative and user-friendly solutions for complex engineering problems. I have a strong background in mechanical engineering with current Master's in Systems Engineering and completed Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering from University of Mumbai and a Professional Mechanical Design certification from Dassault Systèmes.

My Master's of Science in Systems Engineering for Manufacturing from Otto-von-Guericke University actively enhanced various skills and knowledge in product design and development, systems engineering, CAD, Industry 4.0 and digital engineering with excellent learnings from experienced professionals in the field. I am a dedicated team player and a fast learner with excellent communication and interpersonal skills.

I have also gained valuable experience in the automotive industry, working as a Research and Development Engineer at SUJAN INDUSTRIES for 2.5 years. I was involved in the design and development of various products, using 3D CAD tools like PTC Creo, SOLIDWORKS and CATIA. I also participated in testing, analysis, and quality control of the products, ensuring compliance with industry standards and customer specifications.
